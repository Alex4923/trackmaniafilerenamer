## How to Use main.py

`main.py` is a Python script designed to cleanse and rename Trackmania files within a specified directory. It can also copy the renamed files to a different output directory if desired. Below are the steps to use this script:

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
- Make sure you have the necessary permissions to read from and write to the directories you are working with.

### Usage

To run the script, open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located. Use the following command:

```bash
python main.py \<path to folder with replays\> \<path to output folder \(doesnt have to exist\)\>
```

If no output folder is passed it will rename the files in that folder, else they will be copied with a renamed filename to the desired output folder which is done as follows:

```bash
python main.py \<path to folder with replays\>
```
